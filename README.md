# cardstacksample

It would be really helpful if anyone can give direction to fix below explained issue.

This is sample code/app to demonstrate/present random drawing of overlay card inside stack for sample data.

This is derived from or inspired from Flutter UI Challenge: Tinder Matching tutorial by Matt Carroll

Most of the time sample code/app works as expected(till 0:35) and after that stack of cards got messed up for orders of drawing even though passed data on widget tree are as expected.
